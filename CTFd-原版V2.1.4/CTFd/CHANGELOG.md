2.1.4 / 2019-08-31
==================

**General**
* Make user pages show the team's score and place information instead of the user's information if in team mode
* Allow admins to search users by IP address
* Require password for email address changes in the user profile
* The place indicator in `Teams Mode` on the team pages and user pages now correctly excludes hidden teams
* Fix scoreboard place ordinalization in Python 3
* Fix for a crash where imports will fail on SQLite due to lack of ALTER command support
* Fix for an issue where files downloaded via S3 would have the folder name in the filename
* Make `Users.get_place()` and `Teams.get_place()` for return None instead of 0 if the account has no rank/place
* Properly redirect users or 403 if the endpoint requires a team but the user isn't in one
* Show affiliation in user and team pages in the admin panel and public and private user and team pages

**Themes**
* Remove invalid `id='submit'` on submit buttons in various theme files
* Set `tabindex` to 0 since we don't really care for forcing tab order
* Rename `statistics.js` to `graphs.js` in the Admin Panel as it was identified that adblockers can sometimes block the file

**API**
* The team profile endpoint (`/api/v1/teams/me`) will now return 403 instead of 400 if the requesting user is not the captain
* The Challenge API will now properly freeze the solve count to freeze time


2.1.3 / 2019-06-22
==================

**General**
* Fix issue with downloading files after CTF end when `view_after_ctf` is enabled
* Sort solves in admin challenge view by date

* Fixes bug where pages marked as `hidden` weren't loading
* Remove `data-href` from `pages.html` in the Admin Panel to fix the delete button
* Add UI to handle team member removal in Admin Panel
* Fixes account links on the scoreboard page created by `update()`. They now correctly point to the user instead of undefined when in user mode.
* `utils._get_config` will now return `KeyError` instead of `None` to avoid cache misses

**Deployment**
* Use `/dev/shm` for `--worker-tmp-dir` in gunicorn in Docker
* Cache `get_place` code for users and teams.
* Install `Flask-DebugToolbar` in development
* Cache the `/scoreboard` page to avoid having to rebuild the response so often
* Make unprivileged `ctfd` user usable for mysql connection in docker-compose by having the db image create the database instead of CTFd
* Fix bug causing apache2 + mod_wsgi deployments to break

**API**
* Change `/api/v1/teams/[team_id]/members` from taking `id` to `user_id`.
    * Endpoint was unused so the API change is considered non-breaking.
* Add `account_type` and `account_url` field in `/api/v1/scoreboard`
* Separate `/api/v1/[users,teams]/[me,id]/[solves,fails,awards]` into seperate API endpoints
* Clear standings cache after award creation/deletion

**Exports**
* Temporarily disable foreign keys in MySQL, MariaDB, and Postgres during `import_ctf()`
* Add `cache_timeout` parameter to `send_file`response in `/admin/export` to prevent the browser from caching the export

**Tests**
* Fix score changing test helpers to clear standings cache when generating a score changing row


2.1.2 / 2019-05-13
==================

**General**
* Fix freeze time regressions in 2.x
    * Make `/api/v1/[users,teams]/[me]/[solves,fails,awards]` endpoints load as admin so users can see their solves after freeze
    * Make `/api/v1/challenges/[id]/solves` only show solves before freeze time
        * Add the `?preview=true` GET parameter for admins to preview challenges solves as a user
* Team join attempts are now ratelimited

**Tests**
* More linting and autoformatting rules
    * Format Javascript and CSS files with `prettier`: `prettier --write 'CTFd/themes/**/*'`
    * Format Python with `black`: `black CTFd` and `black tests`
    * `make lint` and thus Travis now include the above commands as lint checks
* Travis now uses xenial instead of trusty.


2.1.1 / 2019-05-04
==================

**General**
* Allow admins to hit `/api/v1/challenges` and `/api/v1/challenges/[id]` without having a team to fix challenge previews
* Fix rate-limiting of flag submission when using team mode
* Fixes some modal close buttons not working in the admin panel
* Fixes `populate.py` to assign captains to teams.

**Models**
* Added `Challenges.flags` relationship and moved the `Flags.challenge` relationship to a backref on Challenges
* Added `ondelete='CASCADE'` to most ForeignKeys in models allowing for deletions to remove associated data
    * `Hints` should be deleted when their Challenge is deleted
    * `Tags` should be deleted when their Challenge is deleted
    * `Flags` should be deleted when their Challenge is deleted
    * `ChallengeFiles` should be deleted when their Challenge is deleted
        * Deletion of the file itself is not handled by the model/database
    * `Awards` should be deleted when their user or team is deleted
    * `Unlocks` should be deleted when their user or team is deleted
    * `Tracking` should be deleted when their user or team is deleted
    * `Teams.captain_id` should be set to NULL when the captain user is deleted

**Exports**
* Force `db.create_all()` to happen for imports on `sqlite` or on failure to create missing tables
* Force `ctf_theme` to be set to `core` in imports in case a theme is missing from the import or the instance
* Fix imports/exports to emit and accept JSON properly under MariaDB
    * MariaDB does not properly understand JSON so it must accept strings instead of dicts
    * MariaDB outputs strings instead of JSON for its JSON type so the export serializer will attempt to cast output JSON strings to JSON objects

**Deployment**
* Run as root when using docker-compose
    * This is necessary to be able to write to the volumes mounted from the host


2.1.0 / 2019-04-24
==================

**General**
* Remove Flask-SocketIO in favor of custom Server Side Events code
    * Removed the Flask-SocketIO dependency and removed all related code. See **Deployment** section.
    * Added EventSource polyfill from Yaffle/EventSource
    * Events are now rate-limited and only availble to authenticated users
        * This means real time notifications will only appear to authenticated users
    * Browser localStorage is now used to dictate which tab will maintain the persistent connection to the `/events` endpoint
        * Thanks to https://gist.github.com/neilj/4146038

* Progress bars have been added to some actions which could take time
    * To file uploads on challenge page
    * To file uploads on the page editor page
    * To the import CTF functionality
* Challenge file downloads now require a token to download
    * `/files/<path>` now accepts a `?token=` parameter which is a serialized version of `{user_id: <>, team_id: <>, file_id: <>}`
    * If any of these sections are invalid or the user/team is banned the download is blocked
    * This allows files to be downloaded via `curl` or `wget` (i.e. without cookie authentication)
* Added a team captain concept. Team captains can edit team information such as name, team password, website, etc.
    * Only captains can change their team's captain
    * Captains are the first to join the team. But they can be transferred to the true captain later on
* Cache `/api/v1/scoreboard` and `/api/v1/scoreboard/top/[count]`
    * Adds `cache.make_cache_key` because Flask-Caching is unable to cleanly determine the endpoint for Flask-Restplus
    * This helper may change in a future release or be deprecated by an improvement in Flask-Caching

**API**
* Added /api/v1/teams/[team_id]/members
* Cache `/api/v1/scoreboard` and `/api/v1/scoreboard/top/[count]`
    * Adds `cache.make_cache_key` because Flask-Caching is unable to cleanly determine the endpoint for Flask-Restplus
    * This helper may change in a future release or be deprecated by an improvement in Flask-Caching
* Add `/api/v1/users?notify=true` to email user & password after creating new account
* Fix issue where admins could not modify their own profile or their own team

**Plugins**
* `CTFd.utils.security.passwords` deprecated and now available at `CTFd.utils.crypto`
* Built-in challenge plugins now linkify challenge text properly
* Challenge type plugins do not have to append `script_root` to file downloads anymore as that will now be managed by the API
* Awards are now polymorphic and subtables can be created for them

**Themes**
* Fix spelling mistake in `500.html`
* Removed `socket.io.min.js` from `base.html`
* Added EventSource polyfill from Yaffle/EventSource
* Added `howler.js` to play notification sounds
* Vendored/duplicated files which were shared between the `admin` and `core` themes have been de-duped
    * The files used in the `core` theme should now be considered free to use by other themes
* CTF start and end times are now injected into `base.html` and available in the `CTFd.js` object
* Register page now properly says "User Name" instead of "Team Name" since only users can see the Register page
* Users and Teams pages now use a public and private page.
    * user.html -> users/public.html and users/private.html
    * team.html -> teams/public.html and teams/private.html
* Separate `admin/templates/modals/users/create.html` into `admin/templates/modals/users/edit.html`

**Exports**
* Exports will now properly export JSON for all JSON columns
    * In some configurations the column would be exported as a string.
    * Legacy string columns will still be imported properly.
* Exports from old 2.x CTFd versions should upgrade and be installed properly
    * Any failure to do so should be considered a bug

**Deployment**
* User is no longer `root` in Docker image
    * Errors in writing log files will now fail silently as we expect a future rewrite
    * Logs will now also go to stdout
* Update Dockerfile to create and chown/chmod the folders used by `docker-compose` to store files/logs (`/var/log/CTFd`, `/var/uploads`)
    * This allows the container to write to the folder despite it being a volume mounted from the host
* Default worker changed back to `gevent`
* Removed Flask-SocketIO dependency
    * Removed the `SOCKETIO_ASYNC_MODE` config
* `gevent` is now required to allow the Server Sent Events client polling code to work
    * If you use the provided `wsgi.py` or `gevent` gunicorn workers, there shouldn't be any issues
* Cache `/api/v1/scoreboard` and `/api/v1/scoreboard/top/[count]` which is invalidated on new solves or every minute

    * See https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/0.15.x/middleware/proxy_fix/#werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix.ProxyFix
    * For example to configure `x_for=1, x_proto=1, x_host=1, x_port=1, x_prefix=1` specify `1,1,1,1,1`

**Tests**
* Tests are now executed in parallel
    * When using a non-memory database, test helpers will now randomize the database name to be able to parallelize execution
* Test tool switched from `nosetests` to `pytest`
* Lint tool switched from `pycodestyle` to `flake8`

* Allow `create_ctfd()` test helper to take app configuration as an argument


2.0.6 / 2019-04-08
==================

**Security**
* Fixes an issue where user email addresses could be disclosed to non-admins

**General**
* Users/Teams set to hidden or banned are no longer visible by other users
    * This affects the API and the main user interface. This does not affect admins
* Users without a Team can no longer view challenges when the CTF is in Team Mode

2.0.5 / 2019-03-23
==================

**Security**
* Fixes an issue where user email addresses could be disclosed to non-admins

**General**
* Dockerfile now installs `linux-headers` package from apk
* Hidden teams are no longer visible publicly
* Fixes an issue where long content made it it difficult/impossible to edit flags and hints
* Fix for users not being able to edit portions of their own profile

* Fixes for a user's place on their profile showing a different place than the scoreboard
* Fixes for an issue where dynamic challenge values would appear to change after being solved by a hidden user

**Exports**
* Exports are now saved on disk with `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()` instead of memory during creation
* After importing an export, CTFd will now recreate all tables it expects to be available. This resolves an issue where tables created by plugins would be missing after an import.

2.0.4 / 2019-01-30
==================

**General**
* Block user & team name changes if name changes are disabled (Closes #835)
* Set accounts to unconfirmed if email is changed while `verify_emails` is enabled
* Only allow users to change their email to emails with domains in the whitelist.
* Add `email.check_email_is_whitelisted()` to verify that a user's email is whitelisted.
* Create a `get_config` wrapper around the internal `_get_config` to let us set a default config value (Closes #659)
* Remove `utils.get_app_config()` from memoization and also give it a `default` parameter
* Move `utils.logging.init_logs()` into `utils.initialization` and properly call `init_logs()` to save logs to the logs folder
* Block the creation of users/teams from MLC if registration_visibility is private
* Fix showing incorrect 'CTF has ended' error if `view_after_ctf` is set.
* Fix creating users from the admin panel while name changes are disabled.

**API**
* `/api/v1/teams/<team_id>` now coerced to an int (i.e. `/api/v1/teams/<int:team_id>`)

**Deployment**
* Re-add the `LOG_FOLDER` envvar to docker-compose so we don't try to write to the read-only host
* Stop gunicorn from logging to `LOG_FOLDER` in docker without explicit opt-in
* Add `ACCESS_LOG` and `ERROR_LOG` envvars to docker to specify where gunicorn will log to
* Allow `DATABASE_URL` to contain custom MySQL ports for `docker-entrypoint.sh`
* Drop `WORKERS` count to 1 to avoid dealing with Flask-SocketIO sticky sessions'
* Install `gevent-websocket` and use it by default until we have a better solution
* NOTE: In future releases, websockets functionality will likely be removed. (#852)


2.0.3 / 2019-01-12
==================

**Security Release**

This release resolves a security issue that allowed malicious users to hijack admin browser sessions in certain browsers under certain configurations.

The implemented fix is to require the new `CSRF-Token` header on state-changing requests with a Content-Type of application/json.
The same nonce used for standard POST requests is re-used for the `CSRF-Token` header.

Because of the necessary changes to the API, the previously used call to `fetch()` in themes should now be replaced with `CTFd.fetch()`.

**Security**
* Require `CSRF-Token` header on all API requests.
* Require CSRF protection on all HTTP methods except `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, and `TRACE`.
* Default session cookie to `SameSite=Lax`
* Send initial user information request to MajorLeagueCyber over HTTPS

**General**
* Fix `update_check()` logic so that we don't accidentally remove the update notification.

**Themes**
* Remove explicit usage of `script_root` in public JS.
   * In custom themes, use the `CTFd.fetch()` function (defined in `CTFd.js`) and properly register the url root and CSRF nonce in `base.html` as shown below:
    ```javascript
    var script_root = "{{ request.script_root }}";
    var csrf_nonce = "{{ nonce }}";
    CTFd.options.urlRoot = script_root;
    CTFd.options.csrfNonce = csrf_nonce;
    ```
* Reduce required amount of parameters required for static theme files.
   * i.e. `url_for('views.themes')` no longer requires the themes parameter. It now defaults to the currently in-use theme.


2.0.2 / 2019-01-03
==================

**General**
* Fix regression where public challenges could not be attempted by unauthed users.
* Admin Config Panel UI no longer allows changing of user mode.
* Show notification titles and allow for deleting notifications
    * Update notification UI in admin panel to be similar to the public-facing UI
* Fix subdirectory deployments in a generic manner by modifying `request.path` to combine both `request.script_root` and `request.path`.
    * Also create a request preprocessor to redirect users into the true CTFd app when deploying on a subdirectory.
    * Redirect to `request.full_path` instead of just `request.path`.
* Fix `TestingConfig.SAFE_MODE` not being reset between tests.
* Disable `value` input in dynamic challenge update field since we calculate it on the user's behalf.
* Fix displaying incorrect account link in the solves tab of a challenge modal.
* Pin `normality` version because of an upstream issue in `dataset`.
* Fix `500`'s when users submit non-integer values to `?page=1`

**API**
* Add `/api/v1/notifications/<id>` to allow accessing notifactions by ID.
    * This is currently public but will become permission based later in the future
* Add `account_url` field to the response of `/api/v1/<challenge_id>/solves` so the client knows where an account is located.

**Plugins**
* Add new plugin utilities to register javascript and css files for the admin panel.
    * Also fixed issue where those scripts and files were shared between generated applications


2.0.1 / 2018-12-09
==================

2.0.0 / 2018-12-02
==================

2.0.0 is a *significant*, backwards-incompaitble release.

Many unofficial plugins will not be supported in CTFd 2.0.0. If you're having trouble updating your plugins
please join [the CTFd Slack](https://slack.ctfd.io/) for help and discussion.

If you are upgrading from a prior version be sure to make backups and have a reversion plan before upgrading.

* If upgrading from 1.2.0 please make use of the `migrations/1_2_0_upgrade_2_0_0.py` script as follows:
    1. Make all necessary backups. Backup the database, uploads folder, and source code directory.
    2. Upgrade the source code directory (i.e. `git pull`) but do not run any updated code yet.
    3. Set the `DATABASE_URL` in `CTFd/config.py` to point to your existing CTFd database.
    4. Run the upgrade script from the CTFd root folder i.e. `python migrations/1_2_0_upgrade_2_0_0.py`.
        * This migration script will attempt to migrate data inside the database to 2.0.0 but it cannot account for every situation.
        * Examples of situations where you may need to manually migrate data:
            * Tables/columns created by plugins
            * Tables/columns created by forks
            * Using databases which are not officially supported (e.g. sqlite, postgres)
    5. Setup the rest of CTFd (i.e. config.py), migrate/update any plugins, and run normally.
* If upgrading from a version before 1.2.0, please upgrade to 1.2.0 and then continue with the steps above.

**General**

* Seperation of Teams into Users and Teams.
    * Use User Mode if you want users to register as themselves and play on their own.
    * Use Team Mode if you want users to create and join teams to play together.
* Integration with MajorLeagueCyber (MLC). (https://majorleaguecyber.org)
    * Organizers can register their event with MLC and will receive OAuth Client ID & Client Secret.
    * Organizers can set those OAuth credentials in CTFd to allow users and teams to automatically register in a CTF.
* Data is now provided to the front-end via the REST API. (#551)
    * Javascript uses `fetch()` to consume the REST API.
* Dynamic Challenges are built in.
* S3 backed uploading/downloading built in. (#661)
* Real time notifications/announcements. (#600)

* Countries are pre-determined and selectable instead of being user-entered.
    * Countries stored based on country code.
    * Based on https://github.com/umpirsky/country-list/blob/master/data/en_US/country.csv.
* Sessions are no longer stored using secure cookies. (#658)
    * Sessions are now stored server side in a cache (`filesystem` or `redis`) allowing for session revocation.
    * In order to delete the cache during local development you can delete `CTfd/.data/filesystem_cache`.
* Challenges can now have requirements which must be met before the challenge can be seen/solved.
* Workshop mode, score hiding, registration hiding, challenge hiding have been changed to visibility settings.
* Users and Teams can now be banned preventing access to the CTF.
* Dockerfile improvements.
    * WORKERS count in `docker-entrypoint.sh` defaults to 1. (#716)
    * `docker-entrypoint.sh` exits on any error. (#717)
* Increased test coverage.
* Create `SAFE_MODE` configuration to disable loading of plugins.
* Migrations have been reset.

**Themes**

* Data is now provided to the front-end via the REST API.
    * Javascript uses `fetch()` to consume the REST API.
* The admin theme is no longer considered seperated from the core theme and should always be together.
* Themes now use `url_for()` to generate URLs instead of hardcoding.
* socket.io (via long-polling) is used to connect to CTFd to receive notifications.
* `ctf_name()` renamed to `get_ctf_name()` in themes.
* `ctf_logo()` renamed to `get_ctf_logo()` in themes.

**Plugins**

* Plugins are loaded in `sorted()` order
* Rename challenge type plugins to use `.html` and have simplified names. (create, update, view)
* Many functions have moved around because utils.py has been broken up and refactored. (#475)
* Marshmallow (https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io) is now used by the REST API to validate and serialize/deserialize API data.
    * Marshmallow schemas and views are used to restrict SQLAlchemy columns to user roles.
* The REST API features swagger support but this requires more utilization internally.
* Errors can now be provided between routes and decoraters through message flashing. (CTFd.utils.helpers; get_errors, get_infos, info_for, error_for)

* Many functions have moved and now have dedicated utils packages for their category.
* Create `SAFE_MODE` configuration to disable loading of plugins.


1.2.0 / 2018-05-04
==================

**General**

* Updated to Flask 1.0 & switched documentation to suggest using `flask run` instead of `python serve.py`.
* Added the ability to make static & regex flags case insensitive.
* The `/chals` endpoint no longer lists the details of challenges.
    * The `/chals/:id` endpoint is now used to load challenge information before display.
* Admins can now see what users have solved a given challenge from the admin panel.
* Fixed issue with imports extracting files outside of the CTFd directory.
* Added import zipfile validation and optional size restriction.
* The ctftime, authentication, and admin restrictions have been converted to decorators to improve code reuse.
    * 403 is now a more common status code. Previously it only indicated CSRF failure, now it can indicate login failure
    or other Forbidden access situations.
* Challenge previews now work consistently instead of occasionally failing to show.
* Tests are now randomly ordered with `nose-randomly`.

**Themes**

* Admins now have the ability to upload a CTF logo from the config panel.
* Switched from the `marked` library to `Markdown-It` for client side markdown rendering.
    * This will break Challenge type plugins that override the markdown renderer since we are no longer using the marked renderers.
* Introduced the `ezpg()` JS function to make it easier to draw a progressbar modal.
* Introduced the `$.patch()` AJAX wrapper.
* Team names are truncated properly to 50 characters in `teams.html`.
* The admin panel now uses Bootstrap badges instead of buttons to indicate properties such as `admin`, `verified`, `visible`.

**Plugins**

* Challenge type plugins now use a global challenge object with exposed functions to specify how to display a challenge.
(`preRender()`, `render()`, `postRender()`, `submit()`).
    * Challenge type plugins also have access to window.challenge.data which allow for the previously mentioned functions to
    process challenge data and change logic accordingly.
* Challenge type plugins now get full control over how a challenge is displayed via the nunjucks files.
* Challenge plugins should now pass the entire flag/key object to a Custom flag type.
    * This allows the flag type to make use of the data column to decide how to operate on the flag. This is used to implement
    case insensitive flags.
* Challenge modals (`modal.njk`) now use `{{ description }}` instead of `{{ desc }}` properly aligning with the database schema.
* The update and create modals now inject data into the modal via nunjucks instead of client side Javascript.
* The `utils.base64decode()` & `utils.base64encode()` functions no longer expose url encoding/decoding parameters.


1.1.4 / 2018-04-05
==================

**General**

* [SECURITY] Fixed XSS in team website. (#604)
* Fixed deleting challenges that have a hint associated. (#601)
